\section*{Preface}

These proceedings contain the papers presented at ADCS 2018, the Twenty Third 
Australasian Document Computing Symposium, hosted by University of Otago 
and held in Dunedin, New Zealand

Of the 20 papers submitted, 4 were accepted as full papers and 9 were accepted
as short papers. The full  written  version  of each submission received at
least three anonymous reviews by independent, qualified international experts
in the area. The review process followed a fully double-blind procedure. Dual submissions were explicitly prohibited.  The accepted
contributions cover a diverse range of topics in document computing including efficiency, user models and evaluation, summarisation, and information retrieval
models.

The symposium includes formal presentations which allow for questions and
discussions, but also opportunities to share ideas during interactive sessions
and informal gatherings. Following the success of this format in ADCS 2018, we also invited attendees to present unrefereed posters in an informal poster session. This addition was suggested by ADCS steering committee to increase the chance for researchers, specifically PhD students, to present their early work for feedback. The titles for the posters are listed on the symposium website but not published in the proceedings. Once again we have co-located with the Australasian
Language Technology Workshop (ALTA), sharing all keynote talks (two from ADCS and two from ALTA), a joint presentation session, poster session, and social events.

We would like to thank the members of the program committee for their
commitment to quality reviews. We would also like to thank ACM SIGIR, CSIRO Data61, Google, eBay and the University of Otago
 for their generous support of the event. We would
also like to thank our keynote speakers, Jon Degenhardt (eBay) and Professor David Bainbridge (University of Waikato), for sharing their views of new
research trends in Information Retrieval and Data Science. Finally, we thank all attendees of
ADCS 2018 who made the trip to Dunedin.
